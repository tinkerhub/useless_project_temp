# Baadal Baba ☁︎ 


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Powerpuff Girls


### Team Members
-Team Lead: Diyana Sadath – TKMCE
-Member 2: Asiya Muhammed – TKMCE

### Project Description
Have you ever looked up at a cloudy sky and told your friend "that cloud looks like a cat!", only for your friend to say that you need to get your eyes checked...
Well, we're here with Baadal Baba to not only validate your imagination, but also give it some character ✨

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People can see animals in the clouds... but no one has ever documented these cloud creatures. Where’s the record? The lore? The leaderboard?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made Baadal Baba — the ancient, semi-sentient entity of sky nonsense.
It takes your cloud photos, lets AI hallucinate the animal it sees, gives it a ridiculous backstory, and adds it to the Cloud Lore Wiki.
You can even upvote the weirdest ones and climb the Absurdity Leaderboard.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript
- Frameworks: React, Node.js
- Libraries: TailwindCSS, Lucide, Sonner, Google Generative AI SDK

🎥 Demo Flow (as blessed by Baadal Baba):
Upload Your Cloud – The user clicks “Choose Photo” to upload a majestic sky blob.
Divine Revelation – Once uploaded, Baadal Baba (powered by AI) peers into the cloud and reveals:
A whimsical name...
A dramatic backstory...
The cloud image reborn as a creature.

Choose Your Path – From here, the user can:
- Add the creature to the Wiki (eternal sky archives)
- Like it and boost its absurdity status!
- Seek the Lore – Navigate to the Cloud Lore Wiki to see past hallucinations.
- Chase Glory – Visit the Leaderboard to view the most absurd cloud beings, as voted by fellow sky-watchers.

Simple. Silly. Sacred.

Just how Baadal Baba intended it. ☁️
