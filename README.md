### Project Description
This prototype of an app is a chaotic devil thats triggers a loop of notifications for a certain time period whenever the user recieves a random message/notification. The notification pops up with random pointless facts, cringe dialogues.
This app further adds to the mess by sending roasts that melts your brain whenever user hit backspace.
It adds more to the chaos by pushing the user to solve riddles to close this loop.
