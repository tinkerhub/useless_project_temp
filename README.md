### Project Description
Our parents always say "Oru vaazha vechal mathi aayirunnu.." We usually laugh and ignore it..But what if it was another timeline? What if our parents planted a vaazha instead.? We took that question seriously and worked for the solution..


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
-Many of us often reflect on life choices and wonder, ‚ÄúWhat if things were different?‚Äù.
In a lighthearted context, we questioned: What if parents invested in something simple and sustainable, like planting a plantain tree on the day their child was born?
How much profit could that decision have generated today?
=======

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
-"Born or Grown...what's more profitable?"
Oru vazha is a fun web app that humorously estimates how much profit your parents could have earned if they had planted a plaintain tree on the day you born.Our "oru vazha calculation" is an interactive and humorous web application that:

Collects user details (Name, Date of Birth, Place, and Tea/Coffee preference).

Simulates analysis with witty loading messages (‚ÄúRegressing‚Ä¶ Regretting‚Ä¶ Questioning life choices‚Ä¶‚Äù).

Delivers a fun, nostalgic profit estimation of what a single plantain tree could have earned.


This solution turns a simple ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario into an engaging experience that blends humor, user interaction, and awareness of long-term investments and sustainability.
