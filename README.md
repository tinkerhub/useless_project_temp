# AntiAlgo 🎯

## Basic Details

### Project Description

The project, The Anti-Algorithm, is a reverse recommendation system that takes users’ favorite books, movies, or memes and suggests completely unrelated items. Instead of matching their tastes, the system recommends random, obscure things they’d never think to explore.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People are constantly trapped in their echo chambers, discovering content that aligns too closely with their tastes. How can someone truly expand their horizons if they’re only recommended things they actually like?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Our app deliberately mismatches users’ preferences, injecting a bit of randomness and surprise into their lives!
[randomness at its finest]
