### Project Description
This is a Mood music player wherein it plays songs NOT based on your mood! It's a very mindful, very cutesy webesite developed for all you cutus out there<3

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
It is very tiring to always have the songs we wanna listen to play for us.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a very efficient website where it plays the songs in contrast to your mood. We have apps and websites that play songs that we ask for, so inorder to make people happy we created one that doesn't :)
